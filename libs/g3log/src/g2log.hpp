/** namespace for LOG() and CHECK() frameworks
 * History lesson:   Why the names 'g2' and 'g2log'?:
 * The framework was made in my own free time as PUBLIC DOMAIN but the 
 * first commercial project to use it used 'g2' as an internal denominator for 
 * the current project. g2 as in 'generation 2'. I decided to keep the g2 and g2log names
 * to give credit to the people in that project (you know who you are :) and I guess also
 * for 'sentimental' reasons. That a big influence was google's glog is just a happy 
 *  concidence or subconscious choice. Either way g2log became the name for this logger.
 *
