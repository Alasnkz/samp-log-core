What is this?  
-----
This is a library which provides a full logging-system to be used in any SA-MP plugins. It can also use debug information in an AMX file to provide more information about a native-call (like in which PAWN file and on which line number it was called).

I'm just a normal SA-MP scripter; what do I have to do with this?
-----
You just have to download the library and put it in the root folder of your SA-MP server (where the SA-MP server executable is).

I'm a plugin developer; what do I need to use this library?
-----
You have to download the developer package, use the include files in your project and link the library with your plugin.
Here is a small example on how you could use this library in your plugin:
```pawn
TODO
```
